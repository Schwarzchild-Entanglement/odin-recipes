        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
            General Relativity is one of the crown jewels of 20th Century Modern Physics. This website 
            contains some of the Recipes that leds to it's creation:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: aliceblue;">
            <li><a href="../odin-recipes/recipes/creativity.html">Creativity</a></li>
            <li><a href="../odin-recipes/recipes/physics.html">Physics</a></li>
            <li><a href="../odin-recipes/recipes/math.html">Maths</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Follow these instructions and you should reach at the Einstein
        Field Equations that describe how the curvature of spacetime is affected by mass of object in it
        and how this is perceived as gravity

        <p style="color: aliceblue;">This is a very simplistic take only meant to show how Einstein
        Reached at his Field Equations. General Relativity is a very hard topic and requires years of
        study to even understand.
