        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Once creativity and originality is developed, one must think about the physical problems plaguing Mechanics:</p>
        <ol style="color: aliceblue;">
            <li>No proper definition of absolute time and space</li>
            <li>Differences between Newtonian and Electromagnetic Viewpoints on Refernce Frames</li>
            <li>Is there a Preffered Frame of Refernce?</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
            These lead to Special Relativity and Equivalence Principle which states that there is no
            special difference between an accelerating frame and frame under influence of gravity.
