        <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">Math Needed</h1>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Now that the physical principles are developed, follow the following steps to get to the math 
            needed for relativity
        </p>
        <ol style="color: aliceblue;">
            <li>Apply Physical principles to Euclidean space</li>
            <li>Find out that the equations don't work in flat euclidean coordinate system so you
                need a coordinate system that deals with curved surfaces</li>
            <li>Also find out that you need 4 dimensions,three of space and one of time (Hail Minkowski)</li>
            <li>Differential Geometry deals with higher dimensional curved surfaces while Tensor calculus
                deals with higher dimensional coordinate transformation.
            </li>
            <li>Use use these and voila! You arrive at Einstein Field Equations that shows the evolution of
                Geometry of Space and Time.
            </li>
        </ol>
